Mistakes should be limited to only the player's and coaches's efforts in seeking a victory. Our ongoing efforts aims to improve officiating by further integration of A.I .
The impact of a referee's mistake can be significant. A missed call on a game-changing play can alter the outcome and lead to frustration among players, coaches, and fans. 
The ramifications can extend far beyond the game itself.

While they may seem like simple white lines on the field, the sidelines and out-of-bounds are integral to the structure, strategy, and thrill of football.

Inbounds vs. Out-of-bounds Catch:

For a receiver to complete a catch, they must have possession of the ball with both feet (or another body part) inbounds. If any part of the receiver's body touches the sideline or goes out-of-bounds, the pass is ruled incomplete.

Out-of-bounds Runner:

A running back or any player carrying the ball is considered out-of-bounds when any part of their body touches the sideline or extends beyond it. This results in the end of the play and a potential change of possession.
Sideline Interference:

Coaches, players, and other team personnel must stay within the designated team area on the sideline. Any interference with the officials or opposing players along the sideline can result in penalties.

Player Safety:

Players are encouraged to avoid collisions with objects on the sideline, such as equipment, personnel, or obstacles. Special attention is given to protecting players from injury when they are forced out-of-bounds during the course of play.

Challenges and Reviews:

The sideline plays a significant role in instant replay reviews. Coaches can challenge certain calls, including catches near the sideline. The review process carefully examines whether a player maintained possession while inbounds.
Chain Crew and Officials:

The chain crew, responsible for marking the line of scrimmage, must also be positioned correctly along the sideline. Officials use the sideline as a reference point for various calls, such as spotting the ball and determining first downs.

Sideline Warning:

Teams may receive a sideline warning from officials if players and coaches encroach onto the field during the game. Repeated violations can lead to penalties, impacting field position.
